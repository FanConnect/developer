# Getting Started

## 1. Start from the Boilerplate Template

If you're ready to get started we recommend cloning this repository and copying the [Javascript Boilerplate Template](https://github.com/fanconnect/developer/tree/main/examples/js/boilerplate) and/or the [Preact Boilerplate Template](https://github.com/fanconnect/developer/tree/main/examples/preact/boilerplate) to your own folder.

## 2. Write Code

Once you have a folder for your custom Template, open it in your favorite editor (we prefer [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

To preview your Template see [FanConnect Template Preview](/templates#preview).
