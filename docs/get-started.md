# Getting Started

## 1. Think of an App

Have an idea for an App?  Great!  Apps come in many different shapes and sizes, for example we have Apps for FanConnect TV that are landscape (16x9) and some that are portait.  

If you don't have an idea yet, that's ok!  You can always start from our example [Dad Joke App](https://github.com/fanconnect/developer/tree/main/examples/dad-joke-app) and customize it.

## 2. Start from the Boilerplate App

If you're ready to get started we recommended cloning this repository and copying the [Boilerplate App](https://github.com/fanconnect/developer/tree/main/examples/boilerplate-app) to your custom App directory.

## 3. Write Code

Once you have a directory for your custom App, bring it up in your favorite editor, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) of course ;), and code away!

To preview your changes you will need to run...

```js
yarn (first time only)
yarn start
```

...and open your browser to [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/).
