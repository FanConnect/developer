# Overview

[FanConnect TV](https://fanconnect.tv) is a robust IPTV platform
**purpose-built** for sports venues that includes professionaly designed, pre-built content.

Content on the FanConnect TV platform is a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  Together these files are bundled (we use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)), zipped, and uploaded to the FanConnect TV Content Management System (CMS) as [Templates](./templates).  From there, customers are free to use these [Templates](./templates) on their IPTV network to display on TV screens throughout their venue.

This guide is intended to help get you started building custom content for the FanConnect TV Platform.
