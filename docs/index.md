# Overview

[FanConnect TV](https://fanconnect.tv) is a robust, fully-featured digital experience platform
purpose-built for sports venues that includes pre-built content (we call them Apps) specific to
sports and/or leagues.

## Apps

Think of Apps as a website, running on the FanConnect TV platform. Any App displayed on a TV
screen powered by FanConnect TV is ultimately a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

We've written Apps using vanilla Javascript, Typescript, and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/). Many Apps
integrate to our own systems to meet data integration requirements (sports stats, etc.), or even 3rd party
APIs (e.g. [Dad Joke App](https://github.com/fanconnect/developer/tree/main/examples/dad-joke-app)).

Platform.
